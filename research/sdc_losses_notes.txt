panoptic segm. and depth prediction -> multi-task loss

instance segm loss:
	Mask R-CNN
	multi-task loss on each sampled RoI L = L_cls + L_box + L_mask
	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.08083.pdf
		L_cls: 	-log(p_u) for true class u
		L_box: 	defined over tuple of true bounding box regression targets for class u,v = (v_x,v_y,u_w,u_h) 
			and predicted tuple tuple tu = (tu_x,tu_y,tu_w,tu_h) for class u
		for bounding box regression use
			L_box = Sum smoothL1(tu_i-v_i) with smoothL1(x)   = 	0.5x^2 	,if |x| < 1
										|x|-0.5	,else
semantic segm loss:
	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4038.pdf
	use full image instead of batches as it converges with same #iterations but significantly faster timewise
	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03144v2.pdf
	mask loss weight *10 than score loss (learning rate of 0.03, divided by 10 after 60k mini-batches)
depth prediction loss:
	NYU/Cityscapes: standard L1 loss
	DIW: ranking loss

jointly train all modules by minimizing overall loss function L = a_I*L_I + a_S*L_S + a_D*L_D
	--> weights unknown!
